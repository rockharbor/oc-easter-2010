<p>The story of Easter will be told on Good Friday and Easter Sunday through a blend of dance, music, and teaching from the Bible. On Easter Sunday, new life in Jesus will be celebrated through baptism, where a person is submerged and lifted out of water. This act is both a declarative statement to choose to follow Jesus, as well as a symbolic passage into the new life He offers. </p>
